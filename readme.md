# Projection Visal Acuity Chart or PAC

The Projection Visual Acuity Chart project is a new, self-contained product intended for use on the Android platform. The Project Projection Visual Acuity Chart-Calibration is an Android application developed on the basis of the drawbacks
observed in the existing standalone system in windows. The existing system is an application through which doctors examine the patients vision. The drawback is that the existing system is not portable easily. The Android application developed
will be used in Android devices such as tablets and smart phones, thus easily maintaining the patient details in an efficient manner and displaying the charts using a mini projector connected to the Android device thus displaying different charts with
different character sizes, different number of characters per line and number of lines displayed which helps doctors get information of the patients vision.
